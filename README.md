# tiler
A tiling extension for GNOME that fits my personal needs better than [gTile](https://github.com/gTile/gTile).

## Key bindings
- Super+Alt+left, left half of the screen
- Super+Alt+right, right half
- Super+Alt+up, top half
- Super+Alt+down, bottom half

- Super+Alt+u, top left
- Super+Alt+i, top right
- Super+Alt+j, bottom left
- Super+Alt+k, bottom right

- Super+Alt+d, left third
- Super+Alt+e, two left thirds
- Super+Alt+f, middle third
- Super+Alt+g, right third
- Super+Alt+t, two right thirds

## Configuration
Just change the sources directly.

## Known problems
- Shell-restart required to completely disable the extension
- not tested
- no "undo tiling" function
- ...
